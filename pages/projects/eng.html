        <h4 id="EsEDM"><strong>Etienne&#8217;Emulated Didactic Machine</strong></h4>
        <p>Etienne&#8217;s Emulated Didactic Machine is a project made in 2019 during my Informatics studies in <a href="https://www.unict.it/">Catania Univesity</a>. The project briefly consisted of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Realizing an Instruction Set</li>
            <li>Realizing its Assemblative language</li>
            <li>Making an Assembler </li>
            <li>Making an Emulator of a machine able to work with the Istruction Set</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project has been developed using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">C++</a> Imperative language, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> Functional language and <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> GUI.</p>
        <p>This Project allowed me to obtain 30/30 cum laude in Computers Architecture Course. Learn more about EsEDM <a href="https://github.com/etiennestefa/EsEDM">here</a>.</p>
        <!-- ENIGMA -->
        <h4 id="Enigma!"><strong>Enigma!</strong></h4>
        <p>Enigma! is a C/C++ based emulator of Germany&#8217;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma</a></em> machine that was used during World War II. It is Windows Console based and it allows users to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set the machine</li>
            <li>Encode / Decode</li>
            <li>Encode / Decode from .txt files</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Enigma! , developed between 2017 and 2018, has been presented during the oral part of my High School Exams.</p>
